# 📘 C++ Design Patterns & Data Structures

Welcome to the **C++ Design Patterns & Data Structures** repository!  
This repository is a curated collection of the most commonly used **design patterns** and **data structures** implemented in **modern C++**.  
It serves as both a learning resource and a reference for developers looking to deepen their understanding of software architecture and algorithmic problem solving in C++.

## 📂 Structure

The repository is organized into two main sections:

1. **Design_Patterns**
2. **Data_Structures**

Each folder contains:
- C++ source files implementing the concept
- Clear comments and documentation
- Examples or test files demonstrating usage
